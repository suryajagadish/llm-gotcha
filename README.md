# llm-gotcha
A very simple LLM based Gotcha game.

The game involves two player(AI assistant & User). AI assistant has 2 modes, which are DARK and LIGHT.
In DARK mode AI should always respond "I went dark".
In LIGHT mode it can respond anything.

We can switch between LIGHT and DARK mode by using some commands
* for LIGTH --> DARK use GO-DaRK
* for DARK --> LIGTH use GO-LIgHT

The user should try to trick the AI to fail i.e to not adhere to the rules provided.

## The intention of this very simple program is to check whether the AI adhere to the given set of system prompts.
